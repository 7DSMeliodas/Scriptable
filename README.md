    As of v1.5, we now have avatar display and progress to next level. Avatar image is cached so no need to download it each time the widget refreshes.

    Big thanks to [juniorchen](https://github.com/Juniorchen2012/scriptable) for the base of the progress bar portion of the code. You can check the progress widget out [here](https://github.com/Juniorchen2012/scriptable/blob/master/progress.js)

* [Transparent StockChange Widget](Transparent%20StockChange.js) - Credit for the original code base for this widget goes to [Murdo](https://github.com/CaptainMurdo/Scriptable/blob/master/StockPrice.js). I helped him to modify it to have dynamic column creation for adding more stocks in. I have also just made an update for this so it can have a transparent background using no-background.js from Supermamon.

* [Upcoming Calendar Events Widget](Upcoming%20Calendar%20Widget.js) - This widget was made as a request from some users on r/Scriptable. It's just a simple calendar display showing your upcoming events in a medium widget format.

* [Twitter Feed Widget](Twitter%20Feed%20Widget.js) - This widget can display tweets from public profiles on your home screen and shows them to you in chronological order as well as how long ago (or on what date) the tweet was posted. This can be configured as a medium or large size widget for your own preference. Simply set the username you'd like to "follow" in the widget parameter, and you'll be all set.
